# SQL Challenge Solutions üßê

This repository contains my solutions to a series of SQL challenges completed over the course of multiple weeks. These challenges helped me master key SQL concepts, including database design, data aggregation, optimization, and complex queries. Below are the case studies I have worked on, along with the approach and techniques used for each challenge.

## Challenge Overview

### 1. üçΩÔ∏è[**Danny's Dinner**](https://github.com/Sinchana-SV/SQL-Case-Study/blob/c2aa88860c1778bac5914b0c81ba5b0dde4136af/Danny's%20Diner/Danny's%20Diner.sql)
- **Objective**: Design and execute SQL queries to manage a dinner reservation system for a restaurant.
- **Key Concepts**: Database design, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.
- **Approach**:
  - Created tables for guests, reservations, and menu items.
  - Used `JOIN` to fetch guest and reservation details together.
  - Aggregated data to find the most popular menu items.

### 2. üçï[**Pizza Runner**](https://github.com/Sinchana-SV/SQL-Case-Study/blob/c2aa88860c1778bac5914b0c81ba5b0dde4136af/Pizza%20Runner/Pizza%20Runner.sql)
- **Objective**: Analyze and optimize a pizza delivery business's sales data to determine key performance metrics.
- **Key Concepts**: `JOIN`, `SUM`, `AVG`, data aggregation, performance optimization.
- **Approach**:
  - Joins to combine order, customer, and delivery data.
  - Aggregated data to calculate total sales per customer and identify peak times.
  - Optimized the queries for performance.
 
### 3. üçú[**Foodie-Fi**](https://github.com/Sinchana-SV/SQL-Case-Study/blob/main/Foodie%20Fi/Foodie%20Fi.sql)
- **Objective**: Analyze customer subscription behavior for a food streaming service.
- **Key Concepts**: Window functions (LAG, LEAD), date functions, churn analysis.
- **Approach**:
  - Designed queries to track customer plan changes and subscription durations.
  - Calculated churn rates, upgrade/downgrade trends, and revenue impact.
  - Identified customer retention patterns using time-based analytics.
 
### 4. üè¶[**Data Bank**](https://github.com/Sinchana-SV/SQL-Case-Study/blob/main/Data%20Bank/Data%20Bank-%20Case%20study.sql)
- **Objective**: Derive insights into customer balances, transactions, and data plan usage for a digital banking platform.
- **Key Concepts**:CTEs, CASE WHEN, data transformation, and window functions.
- **Approach**:
  - Calculated customer transaction patterns and average balances.
  - Used CTEs for cleaner, modular query design.
  - Derived business insights on active customers and profitability drivers.
