# SQL Challenge Solutions üßê

This repository contains my solutions to a series of SQL challenges completed over the course of multiple weeks. These challenges helped me master key SQL concepts, including database design, data aggregation, optimization, and complex queries. Below are the case studies I have worked on, along with the approach and techniques used for each challenge.

## Challenge Overview

### 1. üçΩÔ∏è[**Danny's Dinner**](https://github.com/Sinchana-SV/SQL-Case-Study/blob/c2aa88860c1778bac5914b0c81ba5b0dde4136af/Danny's%20Diner/Danny's%20Diner.sql)
- **Objective**: Design and execute SQL queries to manage a dinner reservation system for a restaurant.
- **Key Concepts**: Database design, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`.
- **Approach**:
  - Created tables for guests, reservations, and menu items.
  - Used `JOIN` to fetch guest and reservation details together.
  - Aggregated data to find the most popular menu items.

### 2. üçï[**Pizza Runner**](https://github.com/Sinchana-SV/SQL-Case-Study/blob/c2aa88860c1778bac5914b0c81ba5b0dde4136af/Pizza%20Runner/Pizza%20Runner.sql)
- **Objective**: Analyze and optimize a pizza delivery business's sales data to determine key performance metrics.
- **Key Concepts**: `JOIN`, `SUM`, `AVG`, data aggregation, performance optimization.
- **Approach**:
  - Joins to combine order, customer, and delivery data.
  - Aggregated data to calculate total sales per customer and identify peak times.
  - Optimized the queries for performance.
