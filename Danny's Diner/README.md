# 🍽️ Danny's Diner - SQL Case Study

## 🚀 About the Project

This case study strengthens SQL and data analysis skills by answering real-world business questions based on a fictional diner, **Danny's Diner**.  
Inspired by **Danny Ma's #8WeekSQLChallenge**, this project helps develop SQL querying, joins, aggregations, and window function skills.
